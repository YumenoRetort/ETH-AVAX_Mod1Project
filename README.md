# ETH-AVAX_Mod1Project: Smart Contract Project
This project contains a smart contract project that uses require(), assert(), and revert().


## Description
This project was made in compliance with the requirements for my ETH+AVAX Metacrafters course by creating a smart contract project that uses require(), assert(), and revert().

The scenario in this project is that of a dog shelter. The account that deploys the contract becomes the Shelter Owner, who can then give other dogs up to other accounts for adoption. Other accounts can also return the dogs back to the shelter, provided they have dogs. You can also check whether or not an account has dogs or not.
